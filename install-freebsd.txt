Build ZiPhone CLI on FreeBSD

Make sure pkg is installed. Then execute the command "pkg install gmake gcc".

Then cd into the ziphone-cli directory of the extracted source and execute the command:

gmake -f Makefile.freebsd

If you use make (bsd make) and not gmake this will not build! The makefile uses g++8, you may have to change the CC= value for other gcc versions.
