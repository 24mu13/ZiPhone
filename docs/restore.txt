You need to install iTunes v7.5, run http://whitera1n.com/ituneseraser for Windows or Mac OS X. iTunes v7.5 can also be downloaded from that page. iTunes Eraser does a full uninstall of iTunes so you can install iTunes v7.5.

iTunes v7.5 is special. It's the last version of iTunes that doesn't require talking to Apple's 
servers for restoring and updating devices. It supports restoring/updating OS X 1.0-2.0 beta 3 on the original iPhone and iPod Touch. Once you have the correct iTunes compatible with your desired OS X version, you'll need to restore to the desired 
firmware. To do so, first enter DFU mode:

-Turn off the iPhone or iPod Touch.
-Press the power button for 3 seconds.
-Keep pressing the power button, but also press the home button, for a total of 10 seconds.
-Let go of the power button, but keep holding the home button, for 15 more seconds.

You'll know if it worked if the screen of the iPhone or iPod Touch is black, but not off. Connect 
the iPhone or iPod Touch with a USB Dock cable to the Mac or Windows computer, and open iTunes. 
	Click ok when prompted by iTunes that your iPhone or iPod Touch is in DFU mode. Then place the 
mouse cursor on the restore button. Press down the shift key (on Windows) or the option key 
(on Mac OS X) and click. A new window will open, select your device's 1.0-1.1.5 or 2.0 beta 3 IPSW 
file, and wait for the restore to complete.

If you get an error 1012, 1013, or 1015 you need to  Exit Recovery Mode manually with a utility that supports doing so.
